# Fusion360
This project, part of the VESNA smart greenhouse initiative at UIAM, involves designing a water-resistant case for a weather station and a holder for a photoresistor. The goal was to ensure the protection and proper functionality of the components in outdoor conditions. The designs were created using Fusion 360, and parts were optimized for 3D printing using PrusaSlicer. The project focused on durability, providing reliable weather data collection for the greenhouse environment.
